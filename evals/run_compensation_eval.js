// Eval for the compensation-floor rule in config/criteria.json. This rule is
// never enforced in code - the whole criteria object, compensation_floor
// included, is dumped into agent system prompts as text, and a person
// reading that text is trusted to apply it correctly when deciding whether
// to save a lead. That's a soft constraint, not a hard filter, so it's worth
// checking on its own rather than assuming it always works.
//
// This isolates just that one rule with a single structured-output call (not
// the full Researcher/Screener loop) against a fixed set of labelled
// fixture leads, so a wording change to the rule - or a model change - can
// be checked against known-good decisions rather than trusting a live run
// on faith.
//
// Uses a fake fixture floor (evals/compensation_cases.json), never the real
// one. The real floor is redacted to null in the committed config/criteria.json,
// and this file exists specifically so testing the rule doesn't require
// putting real numbers anywhere. Named compensation_cases.json (not
// cases.json) so it doesn't collide with the existing Screener eval's file.
//
// Deliberately does NOT exit non-zero on a disagreement - a disagreement
// here is something to read and think about, not a build gate.
//
// Usage: npm run eval:compensation
